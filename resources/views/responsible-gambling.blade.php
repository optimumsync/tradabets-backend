            <h4 class="font-weight-bold">1. Commitment to Responsible Gambling</h4>
            <h5>At Tradabets, we are committed to promoting responsible gambling. We believe gambling should be an enjoyable and safe experience for all users.</h5>

            <h4 class="font-weight-bold">2. Self-Assessment</h4>
            <h5>We encourage users to regularly assess their gambling habits. If you believe you may have a gambling problem, consider the following: <br>
                - Are you spending more money and time on gambling than you can afford? <br>
                - Are you neglecting personal responsibilities or activities due to gambling?
            </h5>

            <h4 class="font-weight-bold">3. Setting Limits</h4>
            <h5>To help manage your gambling, we offer tools to set deposit, loss, and time limits on your account. These can be adjusted in the "Responsible Gambling" section of your profile.</h5>

            <h4 class="font-weight-bold">4. Self-Exclusion</h4>
            <h5>If you need a break from gambling, you can self-exclude from our services for a specified period. During this time, you will not be able to access your account.</h5>

            <h4 class="font-weight-bold">5. Underage Gambling</h4>
            <h5>Tradabes strictly prohibits underage gambling. We use advanced verification processes to ensure all users are of legal gambling age.</h5>

            <h4 class="font-weight-bold">6. Education and Awareness</h4>
            <h5>We are dedicated to educating our users about responsible gambling. Regular updates and resources are available on our website to help you stay informed.</h5>
